	H.O.P’s not happy about it, but apparently orders from up above are keeping as many researchers there as possible. Security’s been acting antsy recently, since HC refuses to divert more security to the target. Better for us, atleast.
	Medical’s been having issues, too. Been getting a lot of odd injuries and psychosis incidents, mostly from the miners. Stranger though, there’s been less need for the cloner. Not sure if the miners just got sick of dying or what, but with the upgrade we got recently, you would think NT had prepared for worse.<br><br>
	As for strictly mission-relevant information, I’ve started preparing for the main assault. Work might be sloppy given the time constraint, but be assured that all communications and those AA guns will be offline prior to the arrival of the assault team. Everything should be fine, assuming we aren’t sending assault pods.<br><br>
	P.S: Would have sent this report sooner, but a cave-in happened at my last hideout, so I had to make do. Left a weapon and some prototypes there, so we may want to recover those prior to extraction. It was getting crowded anyway, with everyone lurking around medical."}

		Our mission involved inserting into the facility known as the ‘Archeological and Geological Research Complex’ and extracting an unknown botanical package, codenamed ‘Green Thumb’. Insertion would have been done via Assault Pod towards the southern facility grounds, wherein all hostile forces, be them security or civilian, were to be eliminated, and the package extracted from the deepest part of the ruins that Nanotrasen had uncovered.<br>
		Lastly, the package, all remaining personnel, including assault troops and undercover operatives, were to be extracted outside the ruins via the drop vessel, the E.M.C Absolver. The mission did not go as planned.<br><br>
		Not only had the undercover implant failed to fully disable the anti-air weaponry in the area, they had failed to notify us of what appeared to be a very clear and present occult threat in the A.O. What happened next could only be described as a fucking mess, forgive my unprofessional language.<br>
		Neither assault pod landed in their intended location! Callisto landed on a substation between their Engineering and Security facilities, and Titan’s pod landed dead-center in the main facility! The only thing that prevented both squads from being entirely wiped out was what appeared to be a revolt, which turned out to be the aforementioned occult threat.<br>
		The three-way engagement between NT security forces, our own forces, and the cultists allowed us to set up a strongpoint in the main facility. After multiple hours of this living hellscape, we were able to force both factions to retreat, scattering the cultists and pushing the security forces and their sympathizers out into one of the secondary facilities.<br>
		We’ve been able to control the civilians as of now, but with multiple wounded and heavy resistance towards the southern end of the facility, there was no way we had the manpower to proceed to the objective.<br><br>
		If my opinion on this operation was not evident enough, I am hereby requesting either reinforcements or extraction as soon as possible. I’ve already ignited our signal flares, but have seen no response. I am going to attempt to get this report out via any means possible, however short of flashing the Absolver in Morse, that may take a while."}

	name = "RE: Construction Notice"
	info = {"*The above paper has mostly been redacted, however a response is still visible...*<br><br><br>
		Hello. This is Captain Mandela, recently appointed as the primary site manager of the ‘A.G.R Complex’. I am writing as I have some questions and concerns regarding the state of this facility, as numerous safety concerns have been relayed to me by other members of this facility’s command staff.<br><br>
		What might be the most notable concern is the quality of this facility’s construction. It has been levied to me that the R&D Division has chosen to outsource construction to Theseus Contracting LLC, as they quote, 'Are specialty contractors primarily operating within this region of space, highly qualified in constructing facilities in hazardous environments.'<br>
		Which is primarily true, however you had neglected to mention that this company specialized in space station construction, not planet-side construction, where they were only adequate at, given my research. As the likely result of this, the facility grounds are not properly optimized for this environment, with the electrical systems haphazardly placed in the elements, and heavily outdated telecommunications equipment.<br>
		I have received numerous complaints from my Chief Engineer regarding constant maintenance, and we have not been given modern atmospheric systems, rather just sets of space heaters!<br><br>
		Furthermore, safety concerns have risen amongst the mining and research staff. Notably, a lack of proper weaponry and protective gear to deal with constant threats from mining hazards and wildlife in the area, with security forces being too stretched to secure the most heavily traveled routes among the complex.<br><br>
		Lastly, we had been told that the archeological value of this site was due to a supposed religious presence in the area, of what kind I have not been informed of, however this facility has not been appointed a chaplain. While this may be a minor concern, it is odd to me that most stations are staffed with at least one chaplain at all times, however a facility researching apparent religious history would not be given one?<br><br>
		In summary, I am concerned that this facility has not been built to Nanotrasen Standard, and has been woefully neglected proper equipment and staff that are present in many other stations.<br>
		I have been informed that the blueprints and authorization for this complex were authorized by you alone, which, and I do not mean to offend, may have resulted in overlooking certain standards that would ensure the safe and efficient operation of this facility.<br><br>Regards,<br>Captain Mandela"}

I’d like to file a complaint and/or request a formal investigation as to the amount of equipment and material that’s been lost recently. On a near daily basis, crates of highly valuable research material and some resources have been late to their scheduled delivery, or outright lost in transit!
		There is ONE, SINGULAR, ROUTE. There is ONE ROAD between every single substation in this damned place! There is no way in hell these miners and research staff are getting LOST. We've even put those lamp signs up! I’ve even heard the absolutely ASININE excuse of being driven off by bears. BEARS! Every single miner in this facility has the capability and equipment to kill a few BEARS.<br>
		90% of every shipment is sent by miners, or a team of miners and researchers. I am saddened to say I am not certain as to who specifically is continually doing this, as my shipment data doesn’t include names of the package handlers. I have no idea what these staff have to gain from smuggling ores and research data given how ALL of our supply shuttles land on the exterior grounds under heavy watch!<br><br>
		Not only this, these continuous missteps have gotten me in hot water with the Quartermaster, when I have continuously ensured that every piece of documentation was correct, and every shipment had LEFT on time! It is not my responsibility to babysit grown adults who clearly cannot be trusted to hold a pickaxe right-side-up, let alone move a crate a mile down the road!<br><br>
		I swear, if I hear of ONE more lost shipment, I’m tearing out the alcohol from these reward vendors with my bare hands. The withdrawal would kill them easier than I could.<br><br>

	name = "Research Log, 4/13/XX, Subject 'Green Thumb'"
	info = {"This log marks the end of the past 14 days of extensive research regarding ‘Green Thumb’. Tests and various recovered documentation from the occult foundry have confirmed our hypothesis regarding the nature of the plant itself. Analysis onto the soil substrate determined a high concentration of minerals coinciding with the primary material of the previously established occult presence in the region.<br>
		We’ve determined that under strict conditions, the plant is capable of rapid expansion without the need for traditional sexual reproductive systems.<br><br>
		While the specific intention behind the clearly bio-engineered organism is not known, it is highly likely that it was intended for use as a botanic bio-weapon, seemingly capable of spreading and ‘converting’ areas on its own. We’ve inferred this for a few reasons, however most notably would be a specific organelle within each plant’s cell structure, which has been documented intaking the high concentrations of specific mineral.<br>
		This material is then processed and excreted into a liquid chemical that it pushes along its internal structure. Given that this material is not expelled from the plant, as well as the stringent flourishing conditions, it’s likely that this project was never completed.<br><br>
		As for the compound it excretes, we’ve discovered various occult effects, such as violent reactions with holy water and psychosis when injected into human subjects. Further trials await regarding other species, as well as if it possesses any more beneficial effects.<br><br>
		Currently, trials would indicate that, unless we find any value in spreading occult influence, it would be dangerous to invest significantly into this project without serious safety protocols that this facility does not possess."}
