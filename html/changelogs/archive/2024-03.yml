      obnoxiously.

  ariaworld:
  - bugfix: Refactor, clean and optimize tailbag code to not be a copy/paste of wallets
      but a subtype of it.
  - bugfix: Proper lazylist support for vehicle occupants. NPC mecha pilots can board
      mechas again. (And won't runtime when they try.) Mechs won't try to put themselves
      into themselves as an occupant when boarded by simple animal mecha pilots.
  - tweak: Removed 2 ugly pixels from the human penis size 4 erect size sprite.
  - rscadd: "You can now blow kisses by using the *kiss emote (old emote is still\
      \ usable with *kiss2). This puts a kiss object in your hand, which can be shot/thrown\
      \ at other people to give them a mood boost. If you hit someone with the social\
      \ anxiety quirk a few special things might happen\u223C!"
  - rscadd: 'For coders: Also added a very easy way for coders to add new lipstick
      which special traits, with this update the kiss of death was added (admin spawn
      only), which deals damage when thrown. Have fun adding lipsticks that apply
      crocin / increase arousal when you kiss someone / throw a kiss, or straight
      up shooting lasers out of your mouth :P'
